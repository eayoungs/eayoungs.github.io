Adventures in Data
===========

I'd like to introduce myself and give some background and motivation for the exploration I'm embarking on here.

I am an engineer; I have been trained in electrical & mechanical engineering. I studied renewable energy at Oregon Institute of Technology. During my studies I chose to focus on energy efficiency, specifically in commerical buildings.

I'm an enthusiastic Pythonista with some experience with R. My primary tools are [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and the [Bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).

Having always subscribed to the notion embodied in the old saying, "[It's a poor craftsman that blames his tools](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2380679)", I've always put great stock in selecting my tools and refusing to be limited or defined by accepted practice.

Having grown up with [Commadore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), I've been a computing enthusiast for as long as I can remember.
