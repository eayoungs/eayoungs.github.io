Adventures in Data
===========

I'd like to introduce myself and give some background and motivation for the exploration I'm embarking on here.

I am an engineer; I have been trained in electrical & mechanical engineering. I studied renewable energy at Oregon Institute of Technology. During my studies I specialized in energy efficiency, specifically in commerical buildings. Over my career, I've focussed on existing buildings since they account for the majority of building stock at any given time.

I'm an enthusiastic Pythonista with some modest experience with R. My primary tools are [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and the [Bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). I like to keep things simple, unless there's a good reason.
