Adventures in Data
===========

I'd like to introduce myself and give some background and motivation for the exploration I'm embarking on here.

I am an engineer; I have been trained in electrical & mechanical engineering. I studied renewable energy at Oregon Institute of Technology. During my studies I specialized in energy efficiency, specifically in commercial buildings, since they account for [about 40% of energy consumption](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=86&t=1), the largest sector (buildings, industry, transport) in the United States. Over my career, I've focussed on existing buildings since they account for the majority of building stock at any given time.
Most of the work I've done has involved thermodynamic modeling and simulation of commercial buildings. This is a fairly obscure art and many of the commonly used tools suffer from a lack of awareness in the software development community but this is changing and I'm working to be part of that change.

I'm an enthusiastic Pythonista with some modest experience with R. My primary tools are [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and the [Bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). I like to keep things simple, unless there's a good reason.
