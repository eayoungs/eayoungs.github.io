As my initial blog post, I'd like to introduce myself and give some background and motivation for the exploration I'm embarking on here.

I am an engineer; I have been trained in electrical & mechanical engineering. I studied renewable energy at Oregon Institute of Technology. During my studies I chose to focus on energy efficiency, specifically in commerical buildings. 

Having grown up with Commadore 64, Atari and Nintendo, I've been a computing enthusiast for as long as I can remember. Throughout my career, though I've been frustrated by the limitations imposed by traditional engineering tools which are largely limited to Windows GUI tools and consist mostly of Excel punctuated by the occasional access to Matlab.

Having always subscribed to the notion embodied in the old saying, "[It's a poor craftsman that blames his tools](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2380679)", I've always put great stock in selecting my tools and refusing to be limited or defined by accepted practice.

I'm an enthusiastic Pythonista with some respect & possibly a little reverence for R. My primary tools are [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and the [Bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).
