As my initial blog post, I'd like to introduce myself and give some background and motivation for the exploration I'm embarking on here.

I am an engineer; I have been trained in electrical & mechanical engineering. I studied renewable energy at Oregon Institute of Technology. During my studies I chose to focus on energy efficiency, specifically in commerical buildings.
